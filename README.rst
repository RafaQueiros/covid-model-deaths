The IHME COVID-19 statistical deaths model.  This produces the *death projections* 
displayed on https://covid19.healthdata.org/ (Deaths per day, and Total deaths) and 
described in the pre-print `Forecasting the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 
pandemic on hospital demand and deaths for the USA and European Economic Area 
countries <https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.21.20074732v1>`_.

The model of hospital utilization is not included in this repository and we are 
working on releasing it soon, too!

.. note::

   This package has not yet been configured for use outside the IHME
   infrastructure.  We're working on it! Feel free to submit questions and
   issues using the standard github tools, and we'll respond as soon as we
   can.
